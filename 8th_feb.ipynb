    "The `abc` module in Python stands for \"Abstract Base Classes.\" It provides the infrastructure for defining abstract base classes (ABCs) in Python. An abstract base class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly but serves as a blueprint for other classes to inherit from. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `abc` module is used to create abstract base classes and enforce certain rules or contracts that subclasses must adhere to. It helps in defining a common interface or structure that subclasses should implement, promoting code organization, reusability, and maintainability.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Defining Abstract Base Classes: The `abc` module provides the `ABC` class, which is used as a base class for creating abstract base classes. By inheriting from `ABC`, a class becomes an abstract base class. Abstract methods within the abstract base class are decorated with the `@abstractmethod` decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Enforcing Abstract Methods: Abstract methods defined within an abstract base class have no implementation and must be overridden by the concrete subclasses. If a subclass fails to implement an abstract method, it will raise a `TypeError` during instantiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Providing a Common Interface: Abstract base classes can define a set of methods or attributes that subclasses should implement. This allows developers to rely on the common interface provided by the abstract base class without worrying about the specific implementation details of each subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Polymorphism and Duck Typing: Using abstract base classes, you can achieve polymorphism by treating objects of different subclasses as instances of the abstract base class. This allows you to write more generic code that works with multiple subclasses as long as they adhere to the common interface defined by the abstract base class.\n",

    "1. Define Classes: Create classes to represent the abstract entities or concepts in your program. Classes act as a blueprint for creating objects that encapsulate data and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Access Modifiers: Use access modifiers, such as private and protected attributes, to control the visibility and accessibility of data within a class. In Python, naming conventions are typically used to indicate the level of visibility. A single underscore `_` prefix indicates a private attribute, while a double underscore `__` prefix indicates a strongly private attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Encapsulation: Encapsulate the data by defining methods (getter and setter methods) within the class to access and modify the internal attributes. This way, the internal representation of the data is hidden, and access to it is controlled through these methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Data Validation: Implement data validation and impose constraints on the allowed values or formats of the data within the class. This ensures that the data remains consistent and valid throughout the program.\n",
